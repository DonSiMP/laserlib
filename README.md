# laserlib
Library for 3D LiDAR perception

Author: Alastair Quadros

LaserLib is a c++ library containing work from my PhD thesis on processing 3D point clouds from a Velodyne LiDAR for object classification.

It is developed for close use with python and numpy: all functions have a python wrapper.

It consists of:
- Datastructures for selecting regions of points on range images / point clouds
- Surface normal routines
- Features such as PCA, spin images, line images, interfaces to PCL features
- Knn classification
- Affinity propagation clustering

The best documentation is in the python interfaces, which largely mirror the c++ ones.
